The MiyoLinux Welcome Screen was designed to give users a brief introduction, basic information, and help while running MiyoLinux in a live session. It includes four clickable buttons to aid users in several areas during the live session. The Welcome Screen's .desktop file is hidden by default, but it is used to call the Welcome Screen 9 seconds after the desktop loads. I placed the .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart

Though not included in the code here, the Welcome Screen (and its .desktop file) are excluded from the installed system.
